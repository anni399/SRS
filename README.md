Student Information System is web based application intended to be used by Education
Institutions. The student can register himself/herself on the application by filling out the form. The
application permits only registered Admins to look at student details. It would make searching and
viewing of student details easier & according to various attributes as Name, Course, Semester.
I've coded the complete project from scratch. The user interface/Front-End was designed using
HTML, CSS & Bootstrap. The project uses MySql database & management system. It runs on the
Apache web-server.
